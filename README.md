# Problem Statement
Insurance firms have been running direct marketing efforts through telemarketing to encourage clients to apply for health insurance. So far, we have called all of our target clients, but to save money, we would like to limit the number of calls we make to those most likely to place purchases.

# Task
As a data scientist in the digital department of the insurance company, you are asked to output an attack list that predicts whether or not you will receive an order. Create the most accurate model possible. You need to analyse the data and match it with the quantitative result you get. We will see the analysis which you would perform on the data more than the accuracy of the model. Make all the analysis in a jupyter notebook using pandas and numpy library.
